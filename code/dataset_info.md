| **TB – Total Bilirubin**           | Breakdown product of red blood cells processed by liver | **0.1 – 1.2 mg/dL**             | High → jaundice, obstruction, hepatitis, cirrhosis      |

| **Alkphos – Alkaline Phosphatase** | Enzyme linked to bile ducts                             | **44 – 147 U/L**                | High → bile duct obstruction, cirrhosis, cholestasis    |
| **Sgpt (ALT)**                     | Alanine Aminotransferase                                | **7 – 56 U/L**                  | High → hepatocellular injury (hepatitis, fatty liver)   |
| **Sgot (AST)**                     | Aspartate Aminotransferase                              | **8 – 48 U/L**                  | High → hepatitis, alcohol-related injury                |
| **TP – Total Protein**             | Albumin + Globulin                                      | **6.3 – 8.2 g/dL**              | Low → chronic liver disease, cirrhosis                  |
| **ALB – Albumin**                  | Produced by liver                                       | **3.5 – 5.5 g/dL**              | Low → chronic liver disease, cirrhosis                  |
| **A/G Ratio**                      | Albumin/Globulin Ratio                                  | **1.1 – 2.2**                   | Low → cirrhosis, chronic inflammation                   |
